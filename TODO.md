# TODO

List of TODOS

1. include a flag for raising/returning errors. See what scientist does but initial thought is that we might always want to make sure "control" runs 
2. Controlled vs Uncontrolled Experiment. I think this would provide a better API
3. Review structure of Observations and ExperimentResults
4. Capture exceptions and durations for observations
5. Avoiding clone to build experiment results
6. Cleaning Values
7. Comparing values
8. Publishing Results
9. Parallel computation
10. OTEL publisher - will probably go into a separate lib dedicated to publishers
