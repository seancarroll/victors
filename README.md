# victors

Victor's experiments allow for carefully refactoring critical paths.

This library is inspired by the ruby gem [scientist](https://github.com/github/scientist).

## How to run experiments?

TODO: add example

## Making experiments useful

The examples above will run, but they're not really doing anything. The try blocks don't run yet and none of the results get published. Replace the default experiment implementation to control execution and reporting:

TODO: what to do with results

### Controlling comparison

TODO: how to compare control and candidates

### Adding context

TODO: identifying results

### Expensive setup

TODO: do setup only if experiment runs

### Keeping it clean

TODO:

### Ignoring mismatches

TODO:

### Enabling/disabling experiments

TODO:

### Ramping up experiments

TODO:

### Publishing results

TODO: 

### Testing

TODO:

### Handling errors

TODO: 

### Designing an experiment

TODO:

### Finishing an experiment

TODO: 

## Breaking the rules

TODO: 

### Ignoring results entirely

TODO:

### No control, just candidates



## Name
